Aquila main board FFP0173_Aquila_Main_Board_V1.0.3 reverse engineered.


This board has the H32 chip but I suspect it will be almost identical for the GD32 and N32 chips with the exception of the reserved extruder sensor port and a few minor layout changes.


Unable to identify SMD capacitors so left their values blank.

Some resistor markings were rubbed off and could not confirm their value in circuit.

There are unpopulated components and I have added then when I can but have no idea of the purpose for the ones next to the SDcard slot.



Rev B 

-updated the SDcard circuit as it was not clear if the 7 white components were capacitos or resistors as there were no markings or silkscreen. Seeing a similar circuit for SDcard from something else makes more sense these are capacitors.

-Tidied up some things.

I also added the FFP1073_Connect_Board_V1.0.0 for the inductive sensor on the X3 and S3.
This was done from pictures so cannot verify it is correct.
